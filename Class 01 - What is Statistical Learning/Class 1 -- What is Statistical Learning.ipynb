    "students with little or no background in programming or computer science. The course aims to provide students with a basic understanding of the principles and applications of machine learning and equip them with the skills to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems in social science. The course will cover the fundamental concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning, model selection and evaluation, overfitting, regularization, and feature engineering. Students will use the Python programming language and popular machine learning libraries to implement and evaluate different machine learning algorithms. The course will also include discussions on the ethical and social implications of machine learning in the social sciences."
